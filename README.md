This project focuses on building a data-driven forecasting system to optimise cement planning for a large-scale infrastructure operations. The goal is to predict site-level requirements by combining historical usage, planned pours, inventory, and weather data to help the business move from reactive ordering to proactive demand management. By improving forecast accuracy and visibility, this project will reduce costly stockouts, minimize overstocking and waste, and streamline supply chain operations. The solution will also support sustainability by cutting excess cement use and embodied carbon, while ensuring project schedules stay on track. Ultimately, the forecasting system will help Midlands infrastructure Group (MIG) boost efficiency, lower risk, and strengthen its competitive edge in the construction sector.
